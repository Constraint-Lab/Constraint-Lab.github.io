title: Biz Idea &#35;1 - Liquor Store Distribution
tags: biz-idea distribution

_I think of biz ideas all the time, so this is channeling a bit of [Ed Sheeran's "write 4-5 songs per day"][write 4-5] with most of them being bad. Just write a bunch of them down without judging the merit._

## Context

* **Industry:** Liquor Store
* **Problem:** Liquor stores sell commodities. A bottle of Wild Turkey is the same no matter where you buy it.
* **Solution:** Be more efficient, get more volume

## Idea

Treat this as a delivery logisitics problem rather than a store. Rather than have a single store, open multiple stores:

* The stores should be delivery only.
* Stores are satellite warehouses that only store a popular subset of products.
* A main warehouse stores the entire set of products.
* The main warehouse is within one day drive of each satellite. Deliveries to each satellite occur every day.
* Retail delivery is handled by the satellites. Promise same day delivery for the popular subset and next day delivery for everything else.

## Advantages

* Getting new liquor licenses for each new store is difficult and illegal in some locations. Opening and staffing a new store is difficult and expensive. In this case, a single license covers all sales (I assume).
* More volume by covering more territory. Competing on price is easier when focusing on volume.
* Inventory management could be easier as a single warehouse covers everything. You no longer need enough inventory for visual display.
* Forced to win at efficiency.
* Liquor stores often get access to limited products based on product sales. More volume via a larger market could result in better access.

## Difficulties

* Marketing is different than being the "local liquor store".
* Managing employees is different.
* Delivery logistics and warehouse management is not trivial.
* Legal issues abound with liquor. This whole idea is probably illegal.

## Scale Opportunities

There are opportunities to leverage the ability to manage delivery logistics.

* Expansion across the state is realistic (again, pending legalities).
* Expansion across statelines is realistic (again, pending legalities).
	* There are lots of legal issues. Owning the stores that ship between each other could be a workaround.
* Expansion into other delivery categories is realistic, e.g. household items.

## Competition

* If Amazon sold liquor in the US as it does in other countries, it's unlikely you could compete.
* The convenience/impulse buy opportunity of driving by a liquor store is strong and unavailable.
* Other liquor stores could band together to fight you legally.
* I think liquor stores get weekly delivery, so inventory advantage probably grows only as you open more satellites.
